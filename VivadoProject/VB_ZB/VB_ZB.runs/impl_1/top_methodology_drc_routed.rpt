CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net CLK_100MHZ_FPGA_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): CLK_100MHZ_FPGA_IBUF_inst/O, audio_top/CLK_100MHZ_FPGA, pll/clk_in1
