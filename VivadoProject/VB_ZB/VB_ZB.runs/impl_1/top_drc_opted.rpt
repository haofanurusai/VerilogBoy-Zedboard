The RAMB18E1 boy/high_ram_reg has an input control pin boy/high_ram_reg/WEA[1] (net: boy/dma_n_44) which is driven by a register (boy/cpu/a_reg[3]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
